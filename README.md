## Features
- **View Users**: Fetch a list of users from the API and display them in a table.
- **Add Users**: Add a new user via a form.
- **Edit Users**: Edit an existing user's details.
- **Delete Users**: Remove a user from the list.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through the user list using previous and next page buttons.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- **API**: JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

Challenges Faced:

Implementing pagination logic to navigate through users.

Handling the dynamic updates to the user list with real-time changes from form submissions. 

The JSONPlaceholder API will simulate the addition of new users, but these users won't be permanently stored.

Pagination is handled based on a fixed number of users (10 users available in JSONPlaceholder).

Improvements:

Making the interface more responsive and user-friendly.
Implementing more complex search and filtering options.
Using a more sophisticated backend (e.g., a real database) for managing users.
